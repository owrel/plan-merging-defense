\begin{frame}{Conclusion}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Implemented a whole process for Plan merging
    \item Explored different ways of solving
    \item Defined a Plan Merging approach based on heatmaps as a selection process (which can be used for future work)
    \item We showed that some of the approaches we defined can outperform classical MAPF
\end{itemize}
